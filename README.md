![AstroShot!](https://github.com/Eggz-csm/Portfolio/blob/main/images/Astroshot.PNG?raw=true)

##### Description -
  "Astroshot!" is a fun and unique space shooter; in which you play as a lost ship trying to make it through a vast asteroid feild! Clear as many asteroids as you can with the help of left-behind supplies you find along the way such as ammo, ship repair-kits (health-kits), and even turrets left behind by past deep-space explorers! Try your luck against three different sizes of asteroids which will appear more and more the further you go into the asteroid feild! Go for the high-score and hope you don't come across any asteroid too big in, "AstroShot!"

![LetLooseCover](https://github.com/Eggz-csm/LET_LOOSE/blob/main/PreBuild_Images/letlooseTEMP.png?raw=true)

##### Description -
   Working a simple job in a classified center, one day you will see the alarms flash, you will hear the screams as they burst your ears, and then, a lifeless silence. At that moment you will know that it has been let loose, at that moment, you will be set free. "LET LOOSE" is a metroidvania-shooter with horror game aspects, and engaging environments inspired by games like "Deadcells" and "CARRION". The game will feature multiple guns, enemies, and levels all having their place in the games story. The game has a (Probably) linear story and will also have a small infinite mode (Probably). All lore, weapons, level, and other aspects are subject to change over the course of developement.
