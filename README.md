##### Description -
  "Astroshot!" is a fun and unique space shooter; in which you play as a lost ship trying to make it through a vast asteroid feild! Clear as many asteroids as you can with the help of left-behind supplies you find along the way such as ammo, ship repair-kits (health-kits), and even turrets left behind by past deep-space explorers! Try your luck against three different sizes of asteroids which will appear more and more the further you go into the asteroid feild! Go for the high-score and hope you don't come across any asteroid too big in, "AstroShot!"
